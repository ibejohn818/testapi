# MT Unified AWS API

Unified AWS API using Flask + Restplus.  
Flask + Restplus will define a separation between frontend swagger api
and biz logic. Swagger will be autogenerated by restplus along with
ingress/egress data marshaling and serialization.  

Biz logic and models will be processed by controller layer using 
marshmallow models, dynamodb datastores and SQS queues for scheduling.  

Env is dev'd locally using docker and deployed to AWS API-Gateway + Lambda 
via nimbi infra.


## Local Dev

Local dev using `docker-compose` [click here for docs](docker/README.md)


 
 
## AWS / Nimbi
 
 The AWS infra is defined in a `nimbi` infra.py file.  
 To build & deploy the api to lambda use the following make command:  
 `make build-lambda`
